# Bowling Game Console App

This simple console-based Bowling Game project was created as part of Module 450.

**Description**
This project implements a basic Bowling Game scoring system within a console application. The application prompts the user to enter the number of pins knocked down in each throw and calculates the score based on the standard rules of bowling. It allows users to simulate and score a full game of ten frames.

**Features**
- **Frame-by-frame Scoring**: The application prompts the user for the number of pins knocked down in each throw and calculates the score for each frame.

- **Strike and Spare Handling**: The application recognizes strikes and spares and provides appropriate scoring.

- **Visual Representation of Bowling Pins**: Utilizes ASCII art to visually represent the pins knocked down in each frame for an interactive experience.

**How to Use**
- **Installation**: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

- **Run the Application**: Open the terminal/command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the Python file containing the application (bowling.py or similar).

- **Follow On-Screen Instructions**: Enter the number of pins knocked down in each throw as prompted.
